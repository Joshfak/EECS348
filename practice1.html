    Quick fun fact about Michael Jackson single white glove. It's quite unpopular knowledge but Jackson[1] started
    wearing the famous single white gloves in the early 80's due to his skin condition (vitiligo) early manifestation. 
    It started on his hand and his tireless effort to hide it from the public was what inspired the sequined gloves which was 
    initially worn with the intention to cover his uneven skin patches from his fans. However, as fate would have it, it became
    so iconic, swagg and synonymous to his legendary Billie Jean performance that in the world of dance, music and fashion it'll 
    always be remembered.
